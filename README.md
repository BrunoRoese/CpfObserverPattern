# CpfObserverPattern

This is a project made for the 2022 programacao 2 class from university Feevale.

The idea was to create the observer pattern to show if a CPF is valid or not. Two observers show in their way if the CPF is valid. One displays at the console and the other one writes in a cpfs.txt file.

The validation of the CPF is made inside CpfValidator class

All the methods to add or delete observers from the observable list are inside UTILS -> OBSERVERUTILS

If you run the project all the observers will be added to the observable list and printed. Type "sair" to get out the while loop that asks to type the CPFs.

I used java 11 for this project.
