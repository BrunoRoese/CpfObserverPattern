# CpfObserverPattern

This is a project made for the 2022 programacao 2 class from university Feevale.

The idea was to create the observer pattern to show if a CPF is valid or not. Two observers show in their way if the CPF is valid. One displays at the console and the other one writes in a cpfs.txt file.

The validation of the CPF is made inside CpfValidator class

All the methods to add or delete observers from the observable list are inside UTILS -> OBSERVERUTILS

I used java 11 for this project.
